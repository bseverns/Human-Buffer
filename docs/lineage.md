# Lineage
- 2023: first face-slug mashups — scrappy prototypes documented in early `notes/`.
- 2024: consent-gated composites with Arduino buttons — see `arduino/SaveRecDoubleLongPress/` for the serialized gestures.
- 2025: this repo splits out a tiny, detection-only sketch for classrooms and workshops.
- 2026: workshop playbook lands, integrating the [README playlist](../README.md#workshop-playlist) and [Aftercare ritual](workshop-playbook.md#aftercare).
