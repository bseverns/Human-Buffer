# Assumption Ledger
- Model: OpenCV HAAR frontal face default — document tweaks in the [CHANGELOG](../CHANGELOG.md).
- Thresholds: library defaults; capture overrides in `notes/` for future facilitators.
- Failure cases: side profiles, masks, harsh backlight — bring these into the [surveillance unpacked](workshop-playbook.md#2-surveillance-unpacked-15-min) dialogue.
- Never do: send images off-box, store without consent, add recognition. See the [Ethics manifesto](../ETHICS.md).
- Purge schedule: on startup, delete expired captures (>30 days); rehearse the ritual during [Aftercare](workshop-playbook.md#aftercare).
