# Ethics

- consent is a switch, not a footnote
- detection â‰  recognition; we draw boxes, we don't name people
- all work stays on-device; air-gapped is the vibe
- users choose save or discard every time
- retention is temporary by design; automation wipes leftovers
- known limits: cascades miss faces under hats, weird light, or at angles
