# Ethics

- consent is a switch, not a footnote — see the [workshop playlist](README.md#workshop-playlist) for how we model that out loud.
- detection ≠ recognition; we draw boxes, we don't name people. That distinction powers the [surveillance unpacked](docs/workshop-playbook.md#2-surveillance-unpacked-15-min) conversation.
- all work stays on-device; air-gapped is the vibe. Double-check the [Privacy brief](PRIVACY.md) before you run.
- users choose save or discard every time; the UI flow is mapped in the [data diagram](README.md#data-flow-high-level).
- retention is temporary by design; automation wipes leftovers, and the ritual lives in the [Aftercare](docs/workshop-playbook.md#aftercare).
- known limits: cascades miss faces under hats, weird light, or at angles — log new edge cases in the [Assumption Ledger](docs/assumption-ledger.md).
